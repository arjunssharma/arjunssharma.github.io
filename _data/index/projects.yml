- name: P2P System with Centralized Index
  gh_user: arjunssharma
  repo: P2P-Centralized-Index
  desc: Designed and implemented a file sharing system for downloading RFCs using Java. Implemented a multi-threaded server for concurrency that is capable of carrying out communication with multiple clients simultaneously. Peer to Server application protocol was implemented to make sure that peers and server follow precisely the specifications for their side of the protocol in order to accomplish particular tasks. Peer to Peer application protocol was implemented in a format similar to HTTP protocol to facilitate the P2P communication. 
  
- name: Citation KNN
  gh_user: arjunssharma
  repo: Citation-KNN
  desc: Implemented Citation KNN which is one of the most popular algorithms for solving multiple-instance learning (MIL) problems. It is a lazy learning algorithm which tries to classify a bag of instances by using labelled bags of instances.

- name: Disk Based Mergesort
  gh_user: arjunssharma
  repo: Disk-Based-Mergesort
  desc: Implemented three flavors of Disk based Merge sort viz Basic, Multi-step and Replacement Selection Merge Sort to sort a large binary index file of integer key values. Improved sorting of large data files that can not fit in the main memory of system. Investigated the performance of different algorithms for creating and merging runs during Merge Sort.

- name: Mobile Application Development – ‘Make Soil’
  desc: Developed native application for Android and iOS using React Native, and Firebase for authentication and data storage.
  
- name: B-Trees
  gh_user: arjunssharma
  repo: B-Trees
  desc: Created and managed a binary index file of integer key values as a B-tree supporting add, search and print operations. Investigated the performance by changing the order of the tree.

- name: Car Rental Web App
  gh_user: arjunssharma
  repo: Car-Rental-App
  desc: Performed full stack development on JetBrains using Ruby on Rails with RESTful web services for data access and view. The application has functionalities like creating users profile, allowing different levels of access to different users based on user type (super-admin, admin, users, etc.), searching cars, automatic reservation, email notification, minimum rental period, time elasticity, displaying previous bookings, deleting user’s profile, managing reservations and cars. Deployed this app on Heroku cloud application platform with PostgreSQL and multi-process concurrency configurations.
  
- name: In-Memory Indexing with Availability Lists
  gh_user: arjunssharma
  repo: In-Memory-Indexing-with-Availability-Lists
  desc: Implemented an in-memory indexing scheme to improve search efficiency of large data files containing organized records(using field delimiters). Designed in-memory availability lists to support the reallocation of space for records that are deleted using first-fit, best-fit and worst-fit algorithms to reduce internal and external fragmentation.

- name: Assignment Management System (AMS) Database Application
  gh_user: arjunssharma
  repo: Assignment-Management-System
  desc: Designed the relational database based on objectives of this application and visualized the primary structure with E-R diagram. Implemented an online/offline portal for management of homework assignments and submissions for different courses taken by student using SQL and Java.
  
- name: SimpleDB - Buffer Management Implementation
  gh_user: arjunssharma
  repo: SimpleDB
  desc: Implemented the Least Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy for buffer management in a multi-user transactional database (SimpleDB) for improved performance.
